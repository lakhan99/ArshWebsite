  One of my favorite hobbies is playing the guitar. In my free time, I enjoy learning fingerstyle variations of some of my favorite songs! I began teaching myself  3 years ago with the majority of my learning coming from YouTube videos. It's not as intimidating as it may seem! I also love watching and playing soccer, my favorite team is Arsenal and on an international level I would probably support Belgium.
