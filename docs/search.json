      "description": "One of my favorite hobbies is playing the guitar. In my free time, I enjoy learning fingerstyle variations of some of my favorite songs! I began teaching myself  3 years ago with the majority of my learning coming from YouTube videos. It's not as intimidating as it may seem! I also love watching and playing soccer, my favorite team is Arsenal and on an international level I would probably support Belgium.\n",

I am originally from India but I’ve been living in Canada since 2006. I’ve attended all levels of school here in Toronto.\n            The reason I decided to study Statistics is because I enjoy working with data. I find the idea of taking raw data and being able to tell a story by examining tables and graphs based on that data very fascinating and rewarding. I recently replicated a paper in which we examined how birth rates had changed for younger adults based mainly off of economic and social factors. Ever since I was a kid, I enjoyed working with numbers which motivated me to major in Actuarial Science and learn about the finance and insurance world.\n            \n            \n            Education\n            University of Toronto | Toronto, ON\n            Bachelors of Science | September 2019 - Present\n            \n            \n            Experience\n            Wal-mart | Cap 2/ Fulfillment Associate | December 2020 - Present\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Arsh Lakhanpal\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Bio\n              I am a third year student who is majoring in Actuarial Science and Statistics while minoring in Mathematics at the University of Toronto.
