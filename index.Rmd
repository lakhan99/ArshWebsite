## Bio

I am a third year student who is majoring in Actuarial Science and Statistics while minoring in Mathematics at the University of Toronto. I am originally from India but I’ve been living in Canada since 2006. I’ve attended all levels of school here in Toronto. 

The reason I decided to study Statistics is because I enjoy working with data. I find the idea of taking raw data and being able to tell a story by examining tables and graphs based on that data very fascinating and rewarding. I recently replicated a paper in which we examined how birth rates had changed for younger adults based mainly off of economic and social factors. Ever since I was a kid, I enjoyed working with numbers which motivated me to major in Actuarial Science and learn about the finance and insurance world.
