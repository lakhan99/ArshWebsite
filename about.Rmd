title: " More about me"
description: |
  
  I find it important to keep a balance between a healthy mental and physical life which and I feel my hobbies and interests reflect that. 
  
  One of my favorite hobbies is playing the guitar. In my free time, I enjoy learning fingerstyle variations of some of my favorite songs! I began teaching myself 3 years ago with the majority of my learning coming from YouTube videos. It's not as intimidating as it may seem! I'd highly recommend anyone interested in learning guitar to try, it's therapeutical for me.  
  
  I also love watching and playing soccer, my favorite team is Arsenal and on an international level I would probably support Belgium. I also try to workout atleast 4 times a week as physical health is something that I believe to be extremely important.
  
  My favorite movie is Interstellar and no one can change my mind about that being the greatest movie ever.
